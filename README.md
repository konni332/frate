# frate
**frate** is a developer tool and package manager designed for managing local software installations
without requiring root privileges.
Inspired by Cargo‚Äôs user experience, it provides a clean and simple CLI with commands like init, 
add, list, and sync to manage dependencies declared in a frate.toml manifest and locked with a frate.lock file.

Unlike traditional package managers, frate focuses on user-level installations,
making it ideal for environments where users don‚Äôt have administrative rights.
It aims to streamline dependency management with a straightforward,
Cargo-like workflow, enabling developers to easily install, update,
and manage tools in a reproducible and isolated manner.

**frate** also includes command line sugar to maximize developer comfort. For example ``frate shell``,
to create a new shell session with all local tools in the ``PATH``

| `frate list`             | Lists all tools in `frate.toml`. Use `--verbose` for details.                                       | `frate list --verbose`        |
| `frate run <tool>`       | Runs a tool's binary from `.frate/bin/<tool>/`. Arguments can be passed through.                    | `frate run just -- --version` |

## frate.toml

````toml
[project]
name = "frate"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
just = "1.42.1"
ripgrep = "14.1.1"
````

## Use Case

Frate is designed for developers and teams who want to:

- Install CLI tools without requiring admin/root permissions

- Use a consistent, declarative configuration via frate.toml and frate.lock

- Reproduce development environments easily across machines or CI

- Avoid global pollution of PATH or conflicts between versions

- Share CLI tool dependencies with teammates through versioned lockfiles

It‚Äôs especially useful in the following scenarios:

- Local-only dev setups (e.g., on locked-down systems)

- Portable projects that include their CLI tooling

- CI pipelines that need deterministic toolchains

- Bootstrapping environments without relying on system package managers
